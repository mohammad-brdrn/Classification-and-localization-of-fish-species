# Classification-and-localization-of-fish-species
This project aims to perform a deep learning based classification and regression, in order to classify fish species and also to calculate the bounding box, in which the fishes locate. This project is gotten from a Kaggle competition, accessible at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring/overview
